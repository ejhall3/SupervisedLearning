# SupervisedLearning

This code gives an example of how to:

1. Reduce the dimensions of a matrix using rank-k truncation
2. Fit a liner model to data by solving a linear system of equations
3. Calculate the errors of a supervised learning model with a decision line
4. Provide visualisations of the data

Note: The code for this project is not uploaded here as to avoid academic integrity violations. However, if potential employers are interested in this particular code I am happy to provide it privately via my email (elijahjameshall49@gmail.com).

Background: trainX and testX datasets are matrix representations of hand-drawn 4s and 6s where each entry represents how dark or light a pixel is. trainY and testY are characterizations of these representations, their entires are either 4s or 6s depending on if the hand-drawn digit is a 4 or 6. The train datasets are used to train the model while the test datasets are used to test the model.
